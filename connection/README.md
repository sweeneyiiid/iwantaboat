# Connection between Pi and Computer (or phone?)

I am really just googling stuff for intructions here.

I found: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=18771

which referenced a rabbit hole of other how-to's:

how to set up an adhoc network: https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/AdHoc

demanded to install wireless tools, it looks like the most promising is `stretch`, so went to how to install that:

https://howchoo.com/g/ndg2mtbmnmn/how-to-install-raspbian-stretch-on-the-raspberry-pi

for this, need to install `etcher`: https://etcher.io/

***About to give this a go, want to save to github first, since it involves modifying the micro-sd card... which I am worried could be catastophic***

 - downloaded `etcher`
 - tried to execute from within zipped download, didnt seem to work, so unzipped to `/home/pi/Downloads`
 - still didnt work

HMMMM, it looks like maybe you need to set this up on another computer, and then go from there, that scares me, not sure where to go from here... maybe for another day
