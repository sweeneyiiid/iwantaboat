# Connection between Pi and Computer (or phone?)

I am really just googling stuff for intructions here.

I found: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=18771

which referenced a rabbit hole of other how-to's:

how to set up an adhoc network: https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/AdHoc

demanded to install wireless tools, it looks like the most promising is `stretch`, so went to how to install that:

https://howchoo.com/g/ndg2mtbmnmn/how-to-install-raspbian-stretch-on-the-raspberry-pi

for this, need to install `etcher`: https://etcher.io/

***About to give this a go, want to save to github first, since it involves modifying the micro-sd card... which I am worried could be catastophic***
